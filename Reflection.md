In the LIFO policy, newer hires are most at risk while long-tenured employees are protected, whereas in the priority min-heap policy, people with higher performance scores are safer, which can feel more justifiable but still leaves those with missing or biased data more vulnerable. Using cost as a tie-breaker is questionable, because someone can be “expensive” for reasons they do not control (like benefits or family coverage), so it may help the budget but is not obviously fair to the person. Reviews, OKRs, punctuality, and assignments can all be biased if some people get better projects, more mentoring, or more flexibility than others, so these metrics should be regularly audited across groups and adjusted when patterns of disadvantage show up. LIFO clearly punishes new hires, while a FIFO policy (if used) would push long-tenured employees out first, which can feel like it punishes loyalty. If two people tie, I would rather break ties based on something like tenure, role criticality, or even a simple lottery, instead of cost alone, so that we do not systematically target people just because they are more expensive.
