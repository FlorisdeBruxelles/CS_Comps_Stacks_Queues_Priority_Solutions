# CS Comps 2025 — Assignment B Solutions  
### Stacks, Queues & Priority (Kotlin)

This repository contains the **solution implementations and unit tests** for  
**Assignment B: Stacks, Queues & Priority**, which is part of the CS Comps 2025 project  
“Who Gets Fired First? A Computational Study of Workplace Dynamics Using Stacks, Queues and Priority Queues.”

This repo is intended for **instructor / comps team use only**, not for direct student distribution.



Assignment B asks students to:

- Implement a generic stack and linked queue from scratch.
- Define an employee performance score from multiple data sources.
- Build a min-heap–based priority queue to order layoffs.
- Reflect on the fairness and impact of these policies.

This repository contains our **reference solutions** for those tasks, plus the **JUnit tests** we wrote to check correctness and document behavior.
